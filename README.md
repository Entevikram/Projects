Hand Gesture Recognition with OpenCV and CVZone 
This project demonstrates a real-time hand gesture recognition system using a webcam, powered by OpenCV and the CVZone library. It detects various hand gestures and displays the corresponding emoji and name on the screen.

Features
Real-time Hand Detection: Utilizes CVZone's HandDetector to accurately find hands in the live video feed.

Finger State Recognition: Determines which fingers are up or down.

Emoji & Name Mapping: Maps specific finger configurations to common hand gesture emojis and their names.

Live Display: Overlays the detected gesture's name directly onto the video feed.
